Predicting Breast Cancer based on tumor measurements.


This was an assignment while in class where we used the University of Wisconsin breast cancer data to predict cancer based on tumor size. 

My goal was to eliminate False Negatives in my results as I never want to be responsible for telling someone with cancer that they are cancer free.

I was successful.
